Below are build instructions for Ubuntu 20.04.

These instructions assume that you install in the default location, which is
~/foam/ . Create this folder with:

    cd ~
    mkdir foam


* Obtain and unpack source code (if you read this, you probably already have):

The recommended way is to get the source code through git source code
management system. This way, you can get updates and bugfixes easily by running
"git pull". To install into the default location run:

    cd ~/foam
    git clone git://git.code.sf.net/p/foam-extend/foam-extend-5.0 foam-extend-5.0

* Update your Ubuntu installation:

    sudo apt update
    sudo apt upgrade

* Install required packages:

  sudo apt install git-core build-essential binutils-dev cmake flex \
  zlib1g-dev libncurses5-dev curl bison libxt-dev rpm mercurial \
  graphviz python python-dev metis libmetis-dev libparmetis-dev \
  scotch libscotch-dev

* For Ubuntu 20.04, you need to customize some settings inside the foam-extend
  directory.

  Here is a list of sed commands that will do just that. You can copy/paste
  the following block of commands in a control terminal in order to make
  the necessary adjustments. You will need to be located at the root of your
  foam-extend-5.0 installation for those commands to work.

    sed -i -e 's=rpmbuild --define=rpmbuild --define "_build_id_links none" --define=' ThirdParty/tools/makeThirdPartyFunctionsForRPM
  #

* Set environment variables:

    cd ~/foam/foam-extend-5.0
    source etc/bashrc

* Compile:

    ./Allwmake.firstInstall


* Create user directory:

    mkdir -p $FOAM_RUN

* Create alias:

  # On bash:
  echo "alias fe50='source \$HOME/foam/foam-extend-5.0/etc/bashrc'" >> $HOME/.bashrc

  # On csh:
  echo "alias fe50 'source $HOME/foam/foam-extend-5.0/etc/cshrc'" >> $HOME/.cshrc

And you are ready to start.
